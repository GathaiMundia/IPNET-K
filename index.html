                                <p>Dear professional colleagues, our distinguished guests, delegates, IPC champions, I am pleased to welcome you to the 12thAnnualIPNET-KConference 2025 and the pristine surroundings of this beautiful venue in Naivasha. I am delighted and proud to state that over the past 10 years, IPNT Kenya Annual Conference has become an established event in Kenya, with more than 250 delegates including a substantial international participation from 10 - 15 different countries. When it comes to whole some education and vibrant discussions on a variety of topics and recent advances related to the profession of Infection Prevention and Control in Health Care Setting, IPNET Kenya conference is the event one would turn to. The conference offers a unique platform for participants to exchange UpToDate knowledge and real-life experiences in the prevention of healthcare-associated infections and control of antimicrobial resistance from around the world. Pursuing its mission of improving patient care and safety across Kenya though IPC advocacy and education, IPNET Kenya has once again put together an academic garland of important topics well-chosen by our scientific committee composed of experts in the field. The Keynote talks, symposia, workshops, free papers, and poster sessions are all in the rich program content in the same fashion that made all the past IPNET conferences a grand success. The 11th conference has a theme that resonates with the current life and times of the global community - Building Resilience Through Integrated Approaches to Infection Prevention andControl. Dear Colleagues, the global community is immediately faced with outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases and novel pathogens and old pathogens with novel pathogenicity. Mpox virusvariant, Clade IIb, is a recent example with pandemic potential. A new variant is detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo recently which is much more transmissible among children than the previous strain spreading very fast like wildfire. We are just trying to put COVID 19 behind and move on but Avian influenza (AH5N2) has been marching across the globe for some time with serious implications of antigenic shift and drift to produce novel variants. On 31st July, WHO publishes a news flash on Antimicrobial Resistance in Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae hvKp ST23 Global situation. On the same day, (31st July) Kenya confirmed its first case of Mpox at the Taita Taveta border post with Tanzania. The virus was detected in a person travelling from Uganda to Rwanda through Kenya. The Democratic Republic of Congo is currently experiencing the largest outbreak of the viral disease ever recorded, with tens of thousands of people infected as of June. Our conference is timely and very much required at this time. I look forward to your active participation and wish you exciting, fruitful, and highly enjoyable networking and collaborations during this conference.</p>

                                <p>Dear Delegates, Welcome to the 11th Infection Prevention Network Kenya (IPNET K) Conference 2024! This event provides a unique forum for participants to connect, exchange knowledge, and share experiences in infection prevention and control practices and the global fight against antimicrobial resistance. This years theme focuses on Integrated and Innovative Approaches to Infection Prevention and Control combined with Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Mitigation. These crucial strategies include improved hygiene practices, rapid diagnostics, antibiotic stewardship programs, and new treatment developments. In 2024, we introduced the use of geospatial mapping and artificial intelligence (AI) in infection prevention and control (IPC). These tools help track disease spread, identify hotspots for targeted interventions, and enhance predictive analytics, improving outbreak forecasting and resource allocation. They optimize surveillance, streamline responses, and enhance the effectiveness of IPC strategies, ultimately reducing infection rates and healthcare costs. The conference will cover a wide range of topics with expert guest speakers who will share their knowledge and experiences on practical IPC and AMR applications designed for all healthcare settings. The program follows the tradition of oral presentations, poster sessions, keynote speeches, and roundtable symposia. We are delighted to have you here and wish you a successful and fruitful experience. Enjoy!</p>

Awuor, JOOTRH-KISUMU", content: `<h6>Background</h6><p>Effective management of Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) requires timely treatment of infections with appropriate antibiotics based on culture and susceptibility results. This study profiled the prevalent bacteria in Diabetic foot infection (DFI), their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and associated resistance genes.</p><h6>Methodology</h6><p>A multi-center cross sectional study was conducted from November 2024-May 2025, involving 117 patients with infected DFU, attending selected referral hospitals (JOOTRH and KCRH). Wound swabs were then pre-enriched prior to inoculation onto Blood, MacConkey and Chocolate Agar to isolate aerobic microorganisms. Bacteria identification was based on Gram stain and conventional biochemical tests. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-PE) were identified phenotypically. mecA gene in selected MRSA, and blaCTX-M-1 and blaSHV-1 in ESBL-PE were detected using Uniplex PCR and electrophoresed using 1.5% agarose gel. Data was analyzed using MS. Excel version 15 and Stata version 15 (Stata Corp).</p><h6>Results</h6><p>Poly-microbial infections were detected in 23.8% of patients. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 55.6% (80/144) of isolates. Staphylococcus aureus (36.1% (52/144)) and Proteus spp (13.9% (20/144)) were the most prevalent Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Notably, 98.6% (142/144) of the isolates were multidrug-resistant organisms (MDR). Staphylococcus aureus sensitivity was highest for Gentamycin and Ciprofloxacin (48% each) and lowest for Cefoxitin (2%). Proteus spp sensitivity was highest for Imipenem (87%) and lowest for Tetracycline, Ampicillin and Amoxiclav (0%). mecA gene was identified in 56% (5/9) of MRSA. Among the selected MDR Gram-negative isolates, 60% had blaCTX-M-1, 20 % had blaSHV and both blaCTX-M-1 and blaSHV in one Klebsiella pneumoniae.</p><h6>Conclusion</h6><p>The high prevalence of MDR bacteria in DFI underscores culture and sensitivity testing guided treatment. Detection of resistance genes calls for sustained surveillance efforts, stringent infection prevention and control and alternative therapy exploration.</p>` },

Diagnostic stewardship facilitates targeted antimicrobial therapy and mitigates antimicrobial resistance (AMR) spread by identification of causative organisms. Blood culture diagnostics, in particular, enhance AMR surveillance systems thus improving infection prevention and control measures. To assess the impact of an integrated AMS intervention in improving blood culture collection practices and its potential impact on reducing antimicrobial resistance rates.</p><h6>Methodology</h6><p>A quasi-experimental design evaluated the effectiveness of an antimicrobial stewardship intervention on blood culture uptake over a 6-month pre- and post-intervention period at a County Referral Hospital. The intervention focused on staff sensitization in departments managing suspected bloodstream infections, including the ICU, Casualty, Newborn Unit, and units with immunosuppressed patients, with a designated phlebotomist for sample collection. Outcomes measured included changes in blood sample collection rates and a detailed description of AMR surveillance data, with all data collected and analyzed using Excel</p><h6>Results</h6><p>Blood culture samples increased from 239 samples (April-September 2024) to 468 samples (January-June 2025), a 95.8% rise. Positive blood cultures increased from 12 to 191 samples. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were most frequently identified, decreasing from 67% (8/12) to 51.31% (98/191) of positive cultures in pre- and post-intervention periods. Post-intervention, common isolates included E. coli (8.38%-16/191), A. baumannii (4.19%-8/191), and K. pneumoniae (3.14%-6/191), compared to pre-intervention where K. pneumoniae was prevalent (50%-2/4). Three Candida isolates were identified post- intervention, with none pre-intervention. Most bacterial isolates post-intervention showed resistant profiles based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing, requiring infection. prevention and control measures including environmental cleaning and standard precautions.</p><h6>Conclusion</h6><p>Integration of AMR surveillance via increased blood culture collection is an effective strategy to enhance IPC interventions. These supports integrating AMR surveillance in IPC interventions to contain resistant isolates through enhanced surveillance strategies.</p>` },
                { id: 48, title: "Baseline Assessment of Antimicrobial Stewardship Practices at Nakuru County Referral and Teaching Hospital, Kenya", authors: "Lydia Momanyi, Nakuru County Referral & Teaching Hospital Simon Wangia, Nakuru County Referral & Teaching Hospital Professor Mirfin Mpundu, REACT Africa", content: `<h6>INTRODUCTION</h6><p>Antimicrobial resistance is a major public health concern globally, driven by antibiotic misuse in healthcare, agriculture, and over-the-counter sales. Hospitals with weak antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs contribute significantly, often relying on empirical prescribing inadequate microbiological testing, and poor adherence to treatment guidelines. The Antibiotic Stewardship Programme through Innovation, Research, and Education (ASPIRE) aims to address this crisis through a phased approach, starting with a baseline assessment of AMS practices at Nakuru County Referral and Teaching Hospital.</p><h6>METHODS</h6><p>A mixed-methods approach was used, including retrospective patient file reviews, healthcare worker knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) surveys, costing analysis, WHO AMS functionality assessment, and qualitative interviews. Data was digitized and collected via the DHIS2 platform.</p><h6>RESULTS</h6><p>AMS functionality was low (31%), with leadership commitment scoring j28% due to fragmented governance and underfunding. Empirical prescribing dominated, with ceftriaxone most frequently prescribed (29.6%). Surgical prophylaxis was the top indication (35.1%). Microbiological testing was rare (5.3%), with blood cultures requested most (95%) due to an ongoing study. Adherence to treatment guidelines was inconsistent, with only 19.820% of cases undergoing microbiological confirmation before therapy. Antibiotic de- escalation was primarily driven by unknown reasons (78% of cases) rather than laboratory data (4%), indicating gaps in documentation at the facility. Staff showed fair AMS knowledge (mean scores: 6.7/10). Misuse or incorrect administration affected 208 patients, with a total cost of $7,223.05 for the period under review (approx. $34.77 per patient).</p><h6>CONCLUSION</h6><p>Significant AMS gaps exist weak leadership, empirical prescribing, low diagnostic use, and inconsistent guideline adherence, all fueling AMR and unnecessary costs. Despite fair staff knowledge, implementation is poor. Urgent action is requiredstronger governance, investment in diagnostics, and consistent monitoringto optimize antibiotic use and improve outcomes.</p>` },

Jully Okonji, Association of Public Health Laboratories, Kenya Godfrey Bigogo, Kenya Medical Research Institute, Kenya Alice Ouma, Kenya Medical Research Institute, Kenya, Isaac Ngere, Washington State University Global Health, Kenya", content: `<h6>Introduction</h6><p>Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is essential for understanding population trends and informing prevention strategies. However, conducting AMR surveillance can be a resource-intensive effort. This project explored the feasibility of incorporating phenotypic and genotypic AMR surveillance into existing childhood disease surveillance platforms to detect colonization prevalence with β-lactamase- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales.</p><h6>Methods</h6><p>Rectal swabs were collected from children under five presenting to a clinic in Kibera, Nairobi during May 2025. Swabs were plated on Chromagar selective for extended- spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (ESCrE) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE). Confirmatory identification and susceptibility testing were performed on VITEK 2. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase genes were detected via real-time PCR using the Streck ARM-D kit, targeting ESBL genes (CMY-2, CTX-M-15, CTX-M-14) and carbapenemase genes (OXA-48, IMP, VIM, DHA, KPC, and NDM). Colonization prevalence was determined based on the percent of enrolled children harboring ESCrE or CRE along with the frequency of molecular targets among recovered isolates.</p><h6>Results</h6><p>Among 120 children enrolled, 73% (87/120) and 4% (5/120) were colonized with ESCrE and CRE, respectively. Among 96 ESCrE isolates, 90% (n=86) were found to be Escherichia coli. ESBL genes were detected in 98% (94/96) of ESCrE isolates; CTX-M-15 only was most frequently detected (82%; 79/96), followed by CTX-M-14 (20%, 19/96). Among 7 CRE isolates, carbapenemase genes were detected in 71% (n=7) of the isolates; NDM was detected in 43% (3/7) and OXA-48 was detected in 29% (2/7).</p><h6>Conclusion</h6><p>These findings highlight the feasibility of incorporating AMR surveillance within existing surveillance platforms and the importance of including phenotypic and genotypic characterization of resistant isolates. The high prevalence of colonization with antimicrobial- resistant bacteria in this population demonstrates the urgent need for ongoing AMR surveillance in community and healthcare settings to inform targeted intervention efforts.</p>` },

This has made treating infectious diseases harder, resulting in increased mortalities. The evolution of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has rendered many first-line antibiotics ineffective. Combined and functional AMR surveillance programs have proven to be one of the resolutions towards this emergency. This study described the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of pathogenic bacterial communities from urinary tract infections (UTIs) and established the proportion with AMR at Thika Level 5 Hospital, Kiambu County, Kenya.</p><h6>Methods</h6><p>The retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study design involved the use of structured checklists to obtain demographic data from archived records (2021-2023). Rejuvenated bio-banked isolates with complete records underwent culture and sensitivity analysis for identification and antibiotic resistance detection. Appropriate conventional biochemical tests were done to confirm the identity of the isolated bacterial communities. Antibiotic sensitivity was done on Mueller-Hinton agar using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (CLSI-M100).</p><h6>Results</h6><p>A total of 80 isolates from urine cultures were tested in this study. Of the total, 55 were E. coli (68.75%) and 25 were K. pneumoniae (31.25%). E. coli sensitivity patterns included ceftriaxone (44%), cefuroxime (40%), ampicillin (11%), cotrimoxazole (29%), ciprofloxacin (49%), and nitrofurantoin (81%).

In Kenya, AMR is driven by antibiotic overuse in healthcare, agriculture, and unregulated over-the-counter sales. Hospitals, especially those lacking antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs, contribute through empirical prescribing, limited microbiological testing, and poor guideline adherence. Up to 5090% of patients receive antibiotics before confirmation, leading to inappropriate use and prolonged hospital stays. The Antibiotic Stewardship Program through Innovation, Research, and Education (ASPIRE) seeks to address these issues, starting with a baseline AMS assessment at AAR Hospital.</p><h6>Methods</h6><p>AAR Hospital, a 140-bed private tertiary facility in Nairobi, conducted a mixed-methods study involving: Retrospective reviews of 366 patient files from multiple wards, Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) surveys; AMS assessment using the WHO tool; Economic evaluation; Key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Data collection used digital tools on the DHIS2 platform.</p><h6>Results</h6><p>AMS functionality scored 39%. Empirical prescribing dominated, with amoxicillin- clavulanate (26.9%) most used. Surgical prophylaxis was the top indication (45.9%). Microbiological testing was low (17.5%), with blood cultures most frequent (29.7%). Only 20% of cases had microbiological confirmation before treatment. Antibiotic de-escalation was based on clinical response (74%) over lab data (4%). The lab scored 7577% but used outdated antibiograms. Healthcare workers had moderate AMS knowledge (mean: 6.7/10). 199 patients received misused antibiotics (Irrational drug use), with an average cost of 22.80 USD per patient. Systemic issues included pre-admission antibiotic use, unregulated sales, and hierarchical prescribing practices.</p><h6>Conclusion</h6><p>AARs 39% AMS score mirrors challenges in low- and middle-income countries. Limited testing, empirical prescribing, and poor diagnostics contribute to resistant infections, increased costs, and worse outcomes, especially for low-income patients.</p>` },

Tefera, Ministry of Health- Ethiopia, Resolve to Save Lives", content: `<h6>Introduction</h6><p>Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) is a key component of resilient health systems and a critical enabler of effective outbreak preparedness and response. In Ethiopia, where regular outbreaks consistently undermine public health, the strategic and continuous financing of IPC during outbreak responses is of paramount importance. To this end, Ethiopia secured domestic national level budget with a dedicated line for IPC in 2023 G.C, first of its kind in Sub Sharan Africa.</p><h6>Methods</h6><p>A cross-sectional study was conducted on IPC specific financial resource allocation in 36 public health facilities of South Ethiopia, Sidama, Oromia, and Addis Ababa regions. Quantitative secondary data were sourced from regional finance and economy development bureaus and health care facility level records and IPC inclusive cost calculation was based on relevant budget codes used for IPC and WASH interventions at facility level (6212, 6214, 6218, 6219) for the Ethiopian fiscal year of 2017 (July 2023 to June 2024).</p><h6>Results</h6><p>Findings revealed that budgets for IPC are allocated at a range of 1% to 8% of the total facility budgets, with an overall mean of 4.42%, and standard deviation of 1.71%far less than the 810% suggested for effective IPC and WASH programming. Mean and SD of allocation were lowest for Sidama region (2.82%, SD 0.94%) and highest for Addis Ababa (5.22%, SD 1.47%).</p><h6>Conclusion</h6><p>The lack of a separate budget line for IPC and financial code inconsistency between regions has a negative implication on the effective deployment, utilization, transparency, and accountability of IPC resources during outbreaks. This study suggests the need for immediate policy action to establish dedicated and protected IPC specific financing at sub-national and facility level health budgets. Anchoring IPC funding is not only critical to prevent and rapidly contain outbreaks but also a strategic investment in national and regional health security.</p>` },

These measures are credited with reducing healthcare-associated infections in outbreak settings. However, emerging evidence has raised concerns about the effectiveness of these measures in endemic settings, questioning their impact on patient experience, unnecessary resource utilization, and the limited added benefit over standard precautions. This study aims to examine the current evidence on contact precautions for MDROs.</p><h6>Methods</h6><p>We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of contact precautions for MDRO control. We selected nine studies published between 2022 and 2024 that questioned the effectiveness of CP in controlling hospital transmission of resistant organisms and advocated for alternative approaches, including Enhanced Barrier Precautions. Among these, five studies were considered high-quality based on their methodological rigor and use of control groups.</p><h6>Results</h6><p>While CDC and several studies continue to endorse the use of gowns and gloves for CP, recent evidence suggests that CP may not significantly reduce MDRO transmission in healthcare settings. Moreover, these measures have been associated with negative psychological effects on isolated patients and potential compromises in the quality of care delivered. Additional concerns include the unnecessary use of costly resources when CP is applied universally, regardless of patient risk or setting.</p><h6>Conclusions</h6><p>There is a need for a balanced, evidence-informed approach to evaluating the role of CP in modern infection prevention. Rather than universally applying CP for all patients suspected or confirmed to have MDROs, healthcare providers should consider individual case contexts and transmission risks. A more nuanced, targeted strategy, such as Enhanced barrier precautions (EBP), may offer a more effective and patient-centered alternative.</p>` },

HAIs are now the most common adverse events in healthcare settings. Alarmingly, over half of these infections are resistant to antibiotics. According to WHO, nearly 15 out of 100 patients in healthcare facilities (HCFs) in LMIC are affected by HAIs, and recent estimates based on 94 studies from Africa suggest that HAI prevalence can reach up to 27% in some hospital wards. A 2020 systematic review in Ethiopia found a pooled HAI prevalence of 16%. The objective of the PPS was to estimate the prevalence of HAIs in selected secondary and tertiary HCFs in Ethiopia and identify high-risk wards.</p><h6>Methods</h6><p>A cross-sectional point prevalence study was conducted between February and March 2024. Quantitative data was collected through chart audit to estimate the prevalence of HAI. Descriptive & inferential statistics were used to assess the HAI prevalence in specific wards.</p><h6>Results</h6><p>A total of 1563 patients charts were enrolled in the survey from 10 hospitals where 1281 were eligible for the review. The mean HAI prevalence rate was 16.6 (95 % CI: 12.3% to 20.9%). The highest prevalence was recorded in Adult ICUs (28%) followed by Gynecologic wards (22%) and Pediatric ICU (22%).

As the country strives toward Universal Health Coverage (UHC), integrating a One Health approach into Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) offers a strategic, cross-sectoral pathway to mitigate AMR. This integration connects human, animal, and environmental health, facilitating coordinated, sustainable IPC responses. This paper explores how Kenya is leveraging innovative IPC technologies and locally driven solutions to strengthen health system resilience. Key advancements include mobile-based AMR surveillance tools, community-fabricated personal protective equipment (PPE), solar- powered hand hygiene stations, and on-site water purification systems. These technologies have proven effective in enhancing infection control, particularly in underserved and rural health settings. Sustainable IPC approachessuch as integrating IPC into preservice training, strengthening health worker capacity, institutionalizing behavior change strategies and embedding IPC metrics in national health monitoringare critical to long-term health system strengthening. Additionally, intersectoral collaboration through the One Health platform enhances early detection and response to AMR threats, especially at the human- animal-environment interface. However, implementation challenges persist, including limited funding, fragmented supply chains, and inconsistent adherence to IPC guidelines. Addressing these requires political will, community engagement, and investment in scalable, context-sensitive innovations. By embedding sustainable IPC technologies and One Health strategies into Kenyas national AMR response, the country can significantly reduce the burden of healthcare-associated infections, preserve antimicrobial effectiveness, and accelerate progress toward UHC.</p>` },

The study aimed to assess compliance of hand hygiene practices among nurse students who were attached to the medical ward department in Nyahururu County Referral Hospital.</p><h6>Methods</h6><p>A cross-section observational study was conducted among 154 nurse students who were attached at medical ward department in Nyahururu County Referral Hospital, Laikipia, Kenya between January 2025 and April 2025. Hand hygiene audit tool was used to assess the five critical moments (before touching a patient, before aseptic procedure, after body fluid exposure risk, after touching a patient and after touching the patients surroundings). Data collected was analyzed by use of Microsoft Excel.</p><h6>Results</h6><p>Of the 154 nurse students who were assessed, 61 (40%) were males and 93 (60%) females where their ages ranged between 20 and 25 years. Among them, 6 (4%) students complied before touching a patient, 14 (9%) before aseptic procedure, 49 (32%) after body fluid exposure risk, 74 (48%) after touching a patient and 11 (7%) complied after touching the patients surroundings.</p><h6>Conclusion</h6><p>Overall, Compliance of hand hygiene practices was highest after touching a patient at 48% while lowest before touching a patient at 4%. There is a need to enhance training, regular supervisions on the five critical moments and creating awareness on importance of hand hygiene among nurse students to improve compliance and reduce cross transmission of Health Care Associated Infections.</p>` },
                { id: 41, title: "Assessing Uptake and Completion of Tuberculosis Prevention Therapy Among Healthcare Workers in Rangwe Sub County, Homabay County, Kenya", authors: "Everlyne Mboga", content: `<h6>Introduction</h6><p>Globally, tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of death, with healthcare workers (HCWs) at heightened risk due to occupational hazards. Tuberculosis prevention therapy (TPT) for managing latent TB infection is increasingly important worldwide and in Kenya, aligning with the WHO's vision of 'A world free of TB' and Kenya's goal to eliminate tuberculosis by 2035. This study aimed to assess the uptake and completion of TPT among HCWs in Rangwe sub county, Homabay County, Kenya.</p><h6>Methods</h6><p>Utilizing both quantitative and qualitative approaches, the study included a sample of 119 HCWs from various health facilities. Quantitative data were gathered through face-to-face interviews using a pretested structured questionnaire, while qualitative data was obtained from key -informant interviews with the sub-county TB coordinators, as well as in-depth interviews with 21 health facility managers. Thematic analysis was used for qualitative data.</p><h6>Results</h6><p>Most of the HCWs 88 (74%) of HCWs were initiated on TPT, though only 41 (46%) completed the therapy Among those who completed the therapy, Majority were 26 (63%) were support staff, followed by 7(17%) Laboratory officers, 4(9.8%) clinical officers and 4(9.8%) were nurses. Significant factors influencing TPT uptake included health facility level at 110(93%) awareness and training on TB risk 74(63%) department 98(83%) and having a co-worker with TB 117 (99%).</p><h6>Conclusion</h6><p>Uptake and completion of TPT could be improved through capacity building and enhanced facility-level support and recommended that policymakers at all levels ensure adequate funding, emphasize TB risk perception and reinforce protective measures to increase TPT completion rate.</p>` },
                { id: 18, title: "Misuse of Antibiotic during Pregnancy as a Neonatal Risk towards Antimicrobial Resistance Development.", authors: "Silas O. Awuor, JOOTRH-KISUMU, Pamela Anyango Opepo, JOOTRH-KISUMU", content: `<h6>Background</h6><p>During pregnancy, mothers are at high risk on bacterial infections such as urinary tract infection (UTI) hence frequent prescriptions of antibiotics are done for the management of such infection that threaten maternal and fetal health. Therefore, aggregate signal links in utero antibiotic exposure to neonatal antimicrobial resistance (AMR), raising concerns about its long-term consequences. This research examines the impact of maternal antibiotic use on neonatal AMR, focusing on microbiome disruption, resistance mechanisms, and clinical outcomes.</p><h6>Methodology</h6><p>This was a hospital-based, cross-sectional study conducted between January 2025 and June 2025. The antenatal clinic (ANC) book was used to retrieve UTI history and frequently prescribed antibiotics during pregnancy to manage infections. Laboratory tests were also conducted on the blood samples collected from the newborn baby at day one on the delivery and urine sample at delivery point.</p><h6>Result</h6><p>Overall (n=203), the prevalence of UTI was 60% (95% CI: 53.3%66.7%). The most isolated bacteria were E. coli (59%) and Klebsiella (21%). The prevalence of AMR was found to be 53% (95% CI: 46.1%59.8%). The drugs highly resistant to antimicrobials were Amikacin (88.3%), ampicillin (77.8%), and Norfloxacin (58.5%), while the least resistant drug was chloramphenicol (20%). Same resistant pattern was also observed on the 40% isolated pathogen from the newborn.</p><h6>Conclusion</h6><p>A deeper understanding of vertical transmission of antibiotic resistance from mothers to their offspring is necessary to determine the most effective strategies for reducing antibiotic resistance in early life.</p>` }
